    description={In computer science, the term \emph{Application Programming Interface API} (English: application programming interface) refers to any set of procedures available to the programmer, usually grouped to form a set of tools specific to performing a certain task within a program. The purpose is to achieve an abstraction, usually between the hardware and the programmer or between low-level and high-level software, thereby simplifying programming tasks.}

    text=UML,
    sort=uml,
    description={In software engineering, \emph{UML, Unified Modeling Language} (English: unified modeling language) is a modeling and specification language based on the object-oriented paradigm. \emph{UML} serves an essential role as a “lingua franca” within the object-oriented design and programming community. A large part of the relevant literature uses this language to describe analytical and design solutions in a concise and understandable way for a broad audience.}
