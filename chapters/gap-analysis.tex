\section{Preliminary Risk Analysis}

During the initial analysis phase, several potential risks that could arise were identified.  
Possible solutions to address these risks were then developed.\\

\begin{risk}{Hardware Simulator Performance}
    \riskdescription{the performance of the hardware simulator and its communication could be slow or inadequate, potentially leading to test failures.}
    \risksolution{involving the project leader responsible for the hardware simulator.}
