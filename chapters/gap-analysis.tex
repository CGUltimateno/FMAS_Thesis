\subsection{Gap Analysis of Football Websites}

\subsubsection{Introduction}
The digital landscape for football enthusiasts is vast, with numerous platforms offering a variety of features to cater to different user needs. This gap analysis evaluates 30 football websites based on their unique features, strengths, and weaknesses. The goal is to identify gaps in the market and opportunities for innovation or improvement in the football content delivery space.

\subsubsection{Methodology}
The analysis is based on a feature comparison of the websites, focusing on the following key aspects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Comprehensive News Coverage
    \item Transfer Rumors
    \item Live Scores
    \item Match Highlights
    \item Tactical Analysis
    \item Player Statistics
    \item Fan Engagement
    \item Global Coverage
    \item Premium Content
    \item Football Culture
\end{itemize}

Each website was evaluated based on whether it offers these features (Yes/No). The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:feature-comparison}.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Weaknesses and Gaps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Limited Tactical Analysis}: Many platforms, such as \textbf{Goal.com} and \textbf{LiveScore}, lack in-depth tactical analysis.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Fan-Centric Content}: Websites like \textbf{Transfermarkt} and \textbf{WhoScored} focus heavily on data but offer little in terms of fan engagement or cultural content.
    \item \textbf{Niche Focus}: Platforms like \textbf{Football Italia} and \textbf{The Anfield Wrap} cater to specific audiences, limiting their appeal to a broader audience.
    \item \textbf{Absence of Premium Content}: Most websites do not offer premium content, with \textbf{The Athletic – Soccer} being the exception.
    \item \textbf{Inadequate Global Coverage}: Official league websites (e.g., \textbf{Premier League}, \textbf{La Liga}) focus exclusively on their respective leagues.
    \item \textbf{Limited Visual Content}: While \textbf{101 Great Goals} excels in visual content, many platforms lack video highlights, goal clips, or interactive visualizations.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Opportunities for Improvement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Integration of Tactical Analysis}: Platforms like \textbf{Goal.com} and \textbf{LiveScore} could incorporate tactical analysis to attract more analytical fans.
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Fan Engagement}: Websites such as \textbf{Transfermarkt} and \textbf{WhoScored} could introduce fan-centric features, such as forums, fan stories, or interactive content.
    \item \textbf{Expansion of Global Coverage}: Niche platforms like \textbf{Football Italia} and \textbf{The Anfield Wrap} could broaden their coverage to include other leagues and competitions.
    \item \textbf{Introduction of Premium Content}: Many websites could explore subscription-based models to offer exclusive content, similar to \textbf{The Athletic – Soccer}.
    \item \textbf{Focus on Football Culture}: Platforms like \textbf{Goal.com} and \textbf{Soccerway} could incorporate more content on fan culture, traditions, and documentaries.
    \item \textbf{Improved Visual Content}: Websites lacking visual content could invest in video highlights, goal clips, and interactive visualizations.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
The gap analysis reveals that while many football websites excel in specific areas (e.g., news coverage, live scores, or player statistics), we are cohesively interested into making a system that addresses all the gaps and provides a more holistic user experience that keeps the Fans, coaches and Data analytics experts engaged. We are interested in developing a system that integrates all the features and provides a more comprehensive user experience.
