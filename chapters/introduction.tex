\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

Football, as the world's most popular sport, generates immense interest in predicting match outcomes for fans, analysts, and stakeholders. While traditional football platforms (e.g., \cite{whoscored, transfermarkt}) provide static statistics and live scores, few integrate predictive analytics to forecast results systematically. This thesis addresses this gap by proposing a data-driven football prediction system that combines real-time league data, team/player metrics, and machine learning to deliver actionable insights.  

\section{Motivation and Context}
Modern football analytics increasingly relies on data to inform decisions, from scouting players to optimizing tactics. However, existing systems often prioritize retrospective analysis over forward-looking predictions or lack transparency in explaining forecasts \cite{squawka, athletic}. By contrast, this work emphasizes:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time updates of league standings, team form, and player availability.
    \item Interactive dashboards for exploring predictive scenarios (e.g., "What if Player X is injured?").
    \item Explainable predictions that highlight key factors (e.g., home advantage, recent performance).
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives and Contributions}
The primary objective is to design a prediction system that bridges the gap between statistical models and practical usability. Key contributions include:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item A centralized platform aggregating data from multiple leagues (e.g., \cite{premier, bundesliga}) and player databases (\cite{transfermarkt}).
    \item A user-friendly interface for fans and analysts to interact with predictions, compare teams, and simulate match outcomes.
    \item Validation of prediction accuracy against historical matches and benchmark platforms (\cite{livescore, flashscore}).
\end{itemize}
